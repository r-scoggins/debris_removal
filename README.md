# Debris Ticket Report Generator
This project pulls ticket data from a spreadsheet and generates reports that summarize quantities for specific roadways and inspectors. This generator allows for easy compilation of report data to be pasted over into SiteManager for data entry.
## How It's Made
**Tech Used:** Python, Excel, tkinter

Python is the language used for this project. We utilized tkinter to create a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). This file connects to and pulls data from a spreadsheet that contains ticket data.
## Getting Started
This project requires the following to be installed:  
* Python  
* tkinter  
* pandas  

These can be installed fairly simply via a Google search. Once these are installed, you can use any IDE that can do Python, or any combination of a compiler and text editor. My choice of IDE was Visual Studio Code, as it is extremely easy to setup and the guides online are abundant.
## Usage
Once the .py file is installed, you can run the file and the GUI will show.
Select the tickets spreadsheet you want to compile reports for, and it will create a text file that contains all reports needed to be pasted.
